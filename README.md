# efsim
efsim (Embedded Fractures SIMulator) is a code base for simulating flow and transport in porous media. Fractures are modeled as lower-dimensional surfaces embedded in the surrounding media. 

This code base constitutes the computer implementations developed as a part of the PhD project "Reservoir Simulation in Heterogeneous and Fractured Reservoirs", conducted at NTNU, Trondheim, in the period August 2013 - March 2018.

Source code will appear soon.
